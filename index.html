<p> My name is Jon Opdahl. I was born on July 10th, 1994 to Steve and Edie Opdahl. I am their oldest son, but second of five children. My older sister, Karen, is 21 years old and is studying as a senior in Buenos Aires this fall. My younger brother, Tim (18), is a freshman at the University of Minnesota and my other brother, Daniel (16), is a sophomore at Southwest High School. My younger sister, Christa (12), is in seventh grade. We all grew up in Minneapolis, MN, and everyone, except Karen, still lives there.</p>
<p> Currently, I am studying math and computer science at Luther college as a sophomore. When I'm not studying, I spend my time playing baseball for the Norse, playing guitar, or sleeping mostly. If you want to know more, just follow the links!</p>
