<html><head> <strong> Plans for the Future </head> <body> <h1> Education</h1> <p> I graduated as Valedictorian from Southwest High School (Minneapolis) in 2013. Currently I intend to major in Math and Computer Science, with maybe a minor in Education. </p><p><img src="http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/math-background-8962936.jpg"height=200 width=600></p> <h1> Career </h1> <p> Coming into college, I had planned on studying to become a high school math teacher, but then I took my first computer science class and really enjoyed programming. That caused me to revise my plans and investigate careers in the field of computer science. Now, I hope to land a summer internship with a software company in the Twin Cities and see if I would like a career as a programmer. </p>
