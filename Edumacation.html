<h1> Education</h1>
<p> I graduated as Valedictorian from Southwest High School (Minneapolis) in 2013. Currently I intend to major in Math and Computer Science, with maybe a minor in Education. </p>

<h1> Career </h1>
<p> Coming into college, I had planned on studying to become a high school math teacher, but then I took my first computer science class and really enjoyed programming. That caused me to revise my plans and investigate careers in the field of computer science. Now, I hope to land a summer internship with a software company in the Twin Cities and see if I would like a career as a programmer. </p>
